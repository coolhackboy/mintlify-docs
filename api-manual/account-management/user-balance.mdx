## Important Notes

<Info>
  **Real-time Balance**: The balance returned reflects your current credit amount at the time of the request.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Rate Limiting**: Avoid excessive polling. Cache the balance and refresh only when necessary (e.g., after completing a generation task).
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Credit Deduction**: Credits are deducted only when generation tasks complete successfully. Failed tasks do not consume credits.
</Warning>
