## Usage Guide

- All POST submission requests in the Music Series can query their results through this endpoint. Different models will return different [response fields](#response-fields-files-data).

## Parameter Details

- `task_id` (required): The unique task identifier returned from the music generation submission endpoint

## Developer Notes

- Poll this endpoint to check task completion status
- The `files` array will be empty until the task status is `finished`
- When a task fails, check the `error_message` field for details
- Multiple audio files may be returned for a single task as variations are generated
