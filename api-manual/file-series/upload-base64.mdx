title: "Upload File from Base64"
description: "Upload files to Vidgo API using Base64-encoded data or Data URL format"
openapi: "/api-manual/file-series/upload-base64.json POST /api/common/upload/base64"
---

## Usage Guide

- This endpoint accepts Base64-encoded file data for upload to Vidgo API storage
- Supports both Data URL format (with MIME type prefix) and pure Base64 strings
- Ideal for uploading files that are already Base64-encoded in your application, such as canvas drawings or client-side image manipulations
- Files are immediately accessible via the returned URL and remain available for 72 hours

## Parameter Details

- **Base64 Data Format**:

  - **Data URL format**: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...` (recommended)

  - **Pure Base64 string**: `iVBORw0KGgo...` (without MIME type prefix)

  - The Base64 string must not contain any whitespace, newline characters, or formatting

  - Supported file formats: **JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP** only

  - Maximum upload limit: **1 image per request**

- **Storage Configuration**:

  - All files are automatically stored with a `temp/` prefix in the storage path

  - If you specify `upload_path: "profile-images"`, the actual path will be `temp/profile-images`

  - Files will expire and be automatically deleted **72 hours** after upload

- **File Naming**:

  - If `file_name` is not provided, the system generates a unique name in the format: `{timestamp}_{random}_{extension}`

  - Example auto-generated name: `20251229130857_a8B9cD2e.png`

## Developer Notes

- When to use Base64 upload:

  - Client-side generated images (canvas, screenshots)

  - Images already encoded in Base64 format in your application

  - Small to medium-sized images where encoding overhead is acceptable

- When NOT to use Base64 upload:

  - Large image files (Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%)

  - Files stored on disk (use stream upload instead)

  - Files available via URL (use URL upload instead)

- Ensure your Base64 data is properly formatted without any line breaks or spaces

- For persistent storage needs, download and save the file locally before the 72-hour expiration

## Rate Limits and Quotas

- **Rate Limit**: 5 requests per minute per API key

- When the rate limit is exceeded, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error

- Implement exponential backoff retry logic for handling rate limit errors

## Common Error Scenarios

- **Invalid Base64 Encoding**: The provided Base64 string cannot be decoded

- **Invalid Data URL Format**: The Data URL format is malformed (e.g., missing `data:` prefix or `;base64,` separator)

- **Unsupported File Type**: The decoded file is not in a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

- **Invalid File Data**: The decoded data is empty or corrupted

- **Authentication Error**: Missing or invalid API key in the Authorization header
