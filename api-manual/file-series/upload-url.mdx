title: "Upload File from URL"
description: "Upload files to PoYo AI by providing a remote URL"
openapi: "/api-manual/file-series/upload-url.json POST /api/common/upload/url"
---

## Usage Guide

- This endpoint enables uploading files to PoYo AI by providing a remote URL
- The system automatically downloads the file from the specified URL and stores it in PoYo AI storage
- Ideal for migrating files from external servers or integrating with third-party file sources
- Files are returned with a direct access URL and remain available for 72 hours

## Parameter Details

- **File URL Requirement**:

  - The `file_url` must be a publicly accessible URL using HTTP or HTTPS protocol

  - The remote server must allow the file to be downloaded without authentication

  - Supported file formats: **JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP** only

  - Maximum upload limit: **1 image per request**

- **Storage Configuration**:

  - All files are automatically stored with a `temp/` prefix in the storage path

  - If you specify `upload_path: "avatars"`, the actual path will be `temp/avatars`

  - Files will expire and be automatically deleted **72 hours** after upload

- **File Naming**:

  - If `file_name` is not provided, the system generates a unique name in the format: `{timestamp}_{random}_{extension}`

  - Example auto-generated name: `20251229130857_a8B9cD2e.png`

## Developer Notes

- Ensure your source URL is publicly accessible and does not require authentication or special headers

- The download process may take a few seconds depending on the file size and network conditions

- For persistent storage needs, download and save the file locally before the 72-hour expiration

- The `file_url` and `download_url` in the response are identical and both provide direct access to the uploaded file

## Rate Limits and Quotas

- **Rate Limit**: 5 requests per minute per API key

- When the rate limit is exceeded, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error

- Implement exponential backoff retry logic for handling rate limit errors

## Common Error Scenarios

- **Invalid URL**: The provided URL is malformed or unreachable

- **Download Failure**: Network timeout or connection issues when downloading from the remote URL

- **Unsupported File Type**: The file at the URL is not in a supported image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

- **Authentication Error**: Missing or invalid API key in the Authorization header
